\f0\fs36 \cf0 If the MIMSY_FTEST environment variable is set then, on startup, Mimsy will add a Test menu to the menubar containing menu items to run all tests or an individual test. The tests are *.lua files within MIMSY_FTEST or a sub-directory of MIMSY_FTEST. \
\
Note that making the environment variable available to Mimsy in Mountain Lion is a bit tricky. You can set it via Xcode's manage schemes dialog box or export it from the command line (and use the command line to launch Mimsy).\
\
In general the tests don't aim for 100% code coverage. But there should be tests for seldomly used features (e.g. loading UTF-32 files) and for non-obvious failure modes (e.g. memory leaks).\
\
Functional tests often interact with the GUI by doing things like opening and closing windows. Unfortunately these are often not blocking operations: they don't complete until the event loop has had a chance to run. So functional tests are required to explicitly signal when they have finished running via a call to ftest:passed, ftest:failed, or ftest:expecterror.\
\
Standard tables are provided to interact with Mimsy (see Lua Scripting) but functional tests have an additional table available via the ftest global:\
