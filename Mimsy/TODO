* Get a basic editor running:
	- make sure revert works
	- maybe use a better name for the controll view outlet (be sure to commit 1st)
	- loading needs to talk to the view
	- make sure arbitrary files can be read
	- make sure something sensible happens for binary files
	- get saving working
* Get text files loading and saving.
* Work on styling:
	- 10.7 added support for regexen
	- maybe use two-step process: blocking update of current view, thread for entire doc
	- look into using VIMs color schemes
	- should be a way to include back color in the style file
		` probably need some way to override default back color 
* Maybe handle common extension points via external files:
	- for build systems Python script returning
		` build file (mimsy will watch for changes to this file)
		` targets
		` command lines for the targets
	- for tools declarative file with
		` regex for errors
		` regex for warnings
		` mapping from group number to standard categories like file, line, col
	- language files need to include search URL
	- would be nice to do something for SCCSs
* Work on directory editor.
* Work on building.
* Might want to add to the app store:
	- see what the policy is for open source apps
