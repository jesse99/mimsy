* Work on document class
* Work on styling:
	- look at tmlanguage
	- look into using VIMs color schemes
	- 10.7 added support for regexen
	- maybe use two-step process: blocking update of current view, thread for entire doc
	- should be a way to include back color in the style file
		` probably need some way to override default back color 
* Maybe handle common extension points via external files:
	- for build systems Python script returning
		` build file (mimsy will watch for changes to this file)
		` targets
		` command lines for the targets
	- for tools declarative file with
		` regex for errors
		` regex for warnings
		` mapping from group number to standard categories like file, line, col
	- language files need to include search URL
	- would be nice to do something for SCCSs
* Work on directory editor.
* git modified file indicator is nice.
* Do something with the About box.
* Do something special with file rename when a SCCS is present.
* Would be nice to have some better logging:

* Should have a mode where tab uses tab at the start of lines, but spaces once the line starts.
* Might also want to use that wacky VIM(?) meta-data embedded in files containing info like tab lengths
	- or support a dot file that does the same thing
* Work on building.
* Would be nice to have some sort of indication of dirty files:
	- probably from git's perspective
* XCode and (I guess) TextMate have a bunch of macros:
	- type some abreviation, hit escape, and they are expanded
* Might want to add to the app store:
	- see what the policy is for open source apps
	- look at Prepare for Mac App Store Submission link
