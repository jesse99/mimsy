* Work on windows db
	- use sqlite
* Work on styling:
	- load language files from the bundle
	- style language elements (hard-code styles for now)
		` maybe use two-step process: blocking update of current view, thread for entire doc
	- add a vim language
	- support ConditionalGLob
		` value is glob, space, regex
		` may appear more than once
	- get color files working
		` probably want to add some of the VIM groups, 
		  see http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html NAMING CONVENTIONS
	- add some VIM style color files, vimcolorschemetest.googlecode.com
	- should be a way to include back color in the style file
		` probably need some way to override default back color 
	- languages need to support peeking at the file
		` see /usr/share/vim/vim73/filetype.vim
	- add some sort of search key
		- can appear multiple times
		- augments context menu
	- install language files from the bundle to ~/Preferences
	- add a pref for extensions to languages
	- make sure pref has a button to open the dir with the vim files
* Language files should have support for a run key:
	- value is command line used to run a single file (or *.c file for C based languages)
	- probably triggered by option-R
	- will need to include this in shortcuts (could start this file before hooking it up)
	- possibly also syntax check command
* On startup need to check for install of new files:
	- use date modified (which won't be 100% reliable)
	- copy the old version to a *.bak file
	- or maybe flip it around and add a *.new.* file?
	- write a note to transcript for any backed up
* Would be nice to have a way to create new files:
	- option-N pops up a list users can choose from
	- remember last selection
	- probably mustache (and maybe also arbitrary scripts)
	- mustache could have templates for things like user name, year, maybe custom settings
	- scripts could have a mode to tell mimsy what they need (eg class name)
	- could do similar thing to support inserting language elements
	- may want a way to disable these, maybe it is present but ignored if wrapped in parens
	- could include build scripts (eg C Makefile)
* Maybe handle common extension points via external files:
	- for build systems Python script returning
		` build file (mimsy will watch for changes to this file)
		` targets
		` command lines for the targets
	- for tools declarative file with
		` regex for errors
		` regex for warnings
		` mapping from group number to standard categories like file, line, col
	- language files need to include search URL
	- would be nice to do something for SCCSs
* Work on directory editor.
* git modified file indicator is nice.
* Do something with the About box.
* Do something special with file rename when a SCCS is present.
* Would be nice to have some better logging:
	- http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/2008-01-20/asl-logging
* Should have a mode where tab uses tab at the start of lines, but spaces once the line starts.
* Might also want to use that wacky VIM(?) meta-data embedded in files containing info like tab lengths
	- or support a dot file that does the same thing
* Work on building:
	- might be able to use vim files, eg /usr/share/vim/vim73/compiler/gcc.vim
* Make sure builds call reloadIfChanged
* Would be nice to have some sort of indication of dirty files:
	- probably from git's perspective
* XCode and (I guess) TextMate have a bunch of macros:
	- type some abreviation, hit escape, and they are expanded
* Might want to add to the app store:
	- see what the policy is for open source apps
	- look at Prepare for Mac App Store Submission link
