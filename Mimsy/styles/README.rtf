\f0\fs36 \cf0 The styles files define the text attributes and the background color used together with the language files to do syntax highlighting. Changes to a style file take effect when the file is saved (assuming it's the one in use).\
\
Note that the back color is stored as extended metadata. It will not be visible and may not be preserved if the file is edited by applications other than Mimsy.}
