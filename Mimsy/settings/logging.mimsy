# Currently the only key supported is DontLog which may appear multiple times.
# The value should be a glob and logs with a topic matching any of the globs
# are suppressed.
#
# Topics may have sub-topics. For example the "Text" topic has "Text:Verbose",
# "Text:PersistentRange", and "Text:Styler:Verbose" sub-topics.
#
# Logging currently goes to ~/Library/Logs/mimsy.log
